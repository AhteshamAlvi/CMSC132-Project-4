CLASS: Canon
DESCRIPTION: The canon class represents a cannon for our tank. When it is in use, the tank will shoot a circle. This class handles the cannon's position, direction, and speed,
and is rendered on the screen when its shot
USAGE: Used in the tank game class, we made it so key S and Q are the keys to shoot
*/
